Enable the Elasticsearch repos for Debian
=========================================

As from http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/apt-and-yum-repositories/ Elasticsearch offers Debian repos for
their products Elasticsearch and Logstash. This role adds the repos and their public key.

You can either add both Elasticsearch and Logstash, or specify tags: [elasticsearch] or tags: [logstash]
for only that repo.
